TradableClaimBlocks
A powerful Spigot/Paper plugin for Minecraft 1.21.5 that transforms GriefPrevention claim blocks into tradable, physical vouchers, allowing players to exchange and sell their accrued claiming potential.

⚠️ Requirements (Mandatory Dependency)
This plugin requires the following to function correctly:

* GriefPrevention: The latest stable version of the GriefPrevention plugin is required as a core dependency. TradableClaimBlocks relies entirely on GriefPrevention's API for managing player claim blocks.

* Minecraft Version: 1.21.5 (Spigot/Paper)
